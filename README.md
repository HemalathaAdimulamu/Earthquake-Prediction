# 🌍 Machine Learning Analysis of Earthquake Prediction Based on Seismic Data

This project focuses on predicting earthquakes by analyzing seismic data using **machine learning algorithms**. The goal is to classify earthquake zones based on magnitude into three categories: **Safe**, **Precaution**, and **Danger**.

## 🔍 Key Objectives

- **Earthquake Prediction**: Using seismic data to predict the likelihood of an earthquake.
- **Zone Classification**: Dividing areas into zones:
  - **🟢 Safe Zone**: Low risk of earthquakes.
  - **🟡 Precaution Zone**: Moderate risk, where caution is advised.
  - **🔴 Danger Zone**: High risk, immediate precautions required.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **K-means Clustering**: For unsupervised classification of earthquake zones.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: For robust and accurate earthquake predictions.
- **Python**: Programming language used for implementation.
- **Seismic Data**: Data source for analysis and prediction.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Gather seismic data related to earthquake occurrences.
2. **Model Training**:
   - **K-means Clustering**: Classify data into different zones.
   - **Random Forest Classifier**: Train the model for prediction.
3. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict earthquake zones and classify them into Safe, Precaution, or Danger zones.

## 🌟 Impact

This project aims to contribute to **disaster management** and **early warning systems**, providing crucial information to reduce the impact of earthquakes.
